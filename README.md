<h4>Zombie Apocalypse</h4>
<p>
 Simulation of zombies (red sqares) and humans 
(green squares) interacting on a grid.
Zombies chase humans and humans flee from zombies which 
can only move up, down, left or right in one step
of the simulation and humans are more agile and can move
in these four directions as well as the four neighboring 
diagonal directions. 
 If a zombie catches a human by positioning itself in the 
same cell, human become zombie (change for purple for a 
moment and then red permanently). 
 Some of the cells (black squares) in this grid will 
be marked as impassable and restrict zombie/human movement
so that they can not move through these cells.
